When they were left alone in the cave, they looked around and saw "+tani1+", who told them how they can get out of the cave "+adv1+". They would have to go through three different gates guarded by three different monsters. So, they came up with a plan to escape.

The monster took "+num1+" looks at her then "+ver1+" yelling, let her through to the "+mon1+" and "+mon1+" at the other two gates. This gave them a detailed "+non1+" of the passage ahead.

As they approached a "+ute1+" in the road, they said goodbye and promised to see each other again in "+num1+" years. As the "+safn1+" approaches her home she "+ves1+" with relief as she finds her family. Then she woke up on the "+ad1+" floor in the "+ad1+" cave." ;}
